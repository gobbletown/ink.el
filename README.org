* =ink.el=
A file format for use with =Pen.el=.

This is a text format that is designed for easy editing via emacs, like normal text.

It is loaded and emacs text properties encode the state of the buffer, plus functions for regenerating text.

The prototype will be in emacs lisp using text properties.

- This is a document format that contains and evaluates to the document as it is meant to be viewed.
- It also contains annotations for the transformations, inputs and outputs of those transformations.

** Example
Here is some /ink/ text as the value for the
=task:= key in a yaml file.

The text contains information on the engine,
language and topic required to interpret the
meaning of the task.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml -n :async :results verbatim code
  task: #("Translate Haskell to Clojure" 0 27 (engine "OpenAI Davinci" language "English" topic "programming"))
#+END_SRC

** Goals
- Encode state as well as metadata about what model generated the text.
- Retain information on the completion functions used to generate the document so parts can be re-evaluated at will.
- Become a file format for encoding meta-documents.
  - A meta-document is like a template.
- YASnippet compatibility (may be used as snippets).

** Evaluation
- It allows for re-evaluation.
